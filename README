Scripts that get US Bank account information, such as available balance, by logging
into their website and scraping the information off the webpages.

There are two versions available, ruby and golang.

RUBY: See usbank.rb for the main logic.  You will need to edit quite a few things for it to work.

GOLANG: Significantly faster than the ruby version and is quite a bite easier to get working.
	To use, change the following constants below:
	   USERNAME - your username for USBank.com online banking
	   PASSWORD - online banking password
	   CHALLENGE_QUESTION1 - Your ID Shield question 1
	   CHALLENGE_ANSWER1   - Answer to ID Shield question 1
	   CHALLENGE_QUESTION2 - Your ID Shield question 3
	   CHALLENGE_ANSWER2   - Answer to ID Shield question 2
	   CHALLENGE_QUESTION3 - Your ID Shield question 3
	   CHALLENGE_ANSWER3   - Answer to ID Shield question 3
	   CHALLENGE_QUESTION4 - Your ID Shield question 4
	   CHALLENGE_ANSWER4   - Answer to ID Shield question 4
	   CHALLENGE_QUESTION5 - Your ID Shield question 5
	   CHALLENGE_ANSWER5   - Answer to ID Shield question 5
           and if you use stathat, then
           STATHAT_STATNAME    - passed to PostEZValue(statName, ..., ...)
           STATHAT_EZKEY       - passed to PostEZValue(..., ezkey, ...)

	  That's it!

	  Compile with "go get github.com/moovweb/gokogiri ; go get github.com/stathat/go ; go build usbank.go"
	  Execute this program with -outputFile FILE for where you want the HTML written
	  You can then email FILE to yourself from a bash script. See usbank_cron2.sh
	  for an example.

	 Note: golang1.1 is required (for cookie support)

Warning: not very polished, but it works.
